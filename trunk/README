This software is Calculator of asymptotic complexity decoding algorithms such as
 Prange, Stern, Dummer, MMT and BJMM for a code rate k and an error w equal to 
the Gilbert-Varshamov bound respect to k. You can change the error w, but it 
must be lower than the Gilbert-Varshamov.

  It is possible obtain the parameters for the optimal work factor if we want.
There is also a test to examine the evolution of algorithms when k changes into
[0.01, 0.99] and their related coefficient a for a Bound virtual algorithm, this
 lets us appreciate the quality of algorithm.
